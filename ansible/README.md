## Welcome to Ansible

This facility has two kinds of setup scripts, one for remote setup, and one for local setup.  

The difference is that the remote setup (setup.py) operates from a linux machine to create and provision a new
virtual machine; while the local setup (setup2.yml) only provisions a system from inside itself.  

REMOTE SETUP
------------

It assumes VirtualBox,  Vagrant, and Ansible are available.  

To run genomics-workspace setup with Ansible you must be in a directory (the "launch" directory) that contains the following files:

- `setup.py`
- `setup.yml`
- `vm.yml`
- `vagrantfix.sh`
- `pg_hba.conf`

To do that run the convenience script:

`copy.sh <launch-dir>`

Where `<launch-dir>` is the directory from which you will run `setup.py`. Files in `<launch-dir>` will be shared with the VM,
where it will be known as `/vagrant`.  

This will copy the above files and `dotcp.sh`, a utility to copy your dot files to the VM home
if they exist. To use, copy the dot files wanted to `<launch-dir>` and then from the VM `/vagrant` dir 
run `dotcp.sh`, to copy to the VMs vagrant home.  It will recognize: .profile .bashrc .vimrc and .inputrc.  

While you can run ansible-playbook directly, for simplicity it is best to use the python wrapper *`setup.py`*, 
which calls *ansible-playbook* with the wanted flags and arguments.

Running time is approximately 20 minutes, including VM creation.

This is the usage of `setup.py`:

setup.py

host   = system where you run this command.
target = VM to create or remote system where to setup django-blast.

Installs django-blast project in target system

Usage:

setup.py [-a/-add <ip-addr>] [-i/--inv <inv-file>] [-r/--repo  <repo>] \
        [-u/--user <user-name>] [-v/--vm <vm-name>] <target>

        target must be defined in the Ansible inventory file and it must be a single
        system, not a system group, because IP addresses are assigned singly. 

        If you create only one VM there is no need to specify the -a <ap-addr>
        option, unless the default vagrant address is already in use.  You can
        check by looking in the Vagrant file created in the current directory.
        after setup.py runs.

        If you want to create a second or more VMs then chose a new IP address
        within the range of other VMs already created, and pass it to setup.py
        with the -a <ip-addr> option.

        Add /etc/host entries for target, if inventory uses target names,
        or add the new IP address instead.

        Creates a 'django-blast' directory in the remote user's home directory and
        makes it a virtual environment, places the django-blast project in it,
        and installs dependencies.

        if the -a/--addr <ip-addr> option and argument are present
    the new vm will use the given IP address.
Default: as in the default Vagrantfile. (usually 192.168.33.10)
    This argument requires the -v <vm-name> argument to be present also.

    if the -i/--inv <inv-file> option and argument are present
    it passes to Ansible the <inv-file> file to use as inventory.
    Default: /etc/ansible/hosts

    if the -r/--repo <repo> option and argument are present
    it assumes <repo> is a directory, in the host system, containing the
    django-blast project, and it copies its contents into the django-blast
    directory of the target. Default: clone a fresh repo.

    If the -u/--user <user-name> option and argument are present,
    it uses <user-name> as the user in the target system.
    If creating a new VM, (-v) sets <user-name> automatically to 'vagrant'.
    Default: current user name.

    If the -v/--vm <vm-name>  option and argument are present,
    it creates a CentOS VM into which to do the setup.

    Options -v and -u are mutually exclusive.
    Options -a and -v are mutually inclusive.


    First steps:

# Copy inventory file to default dir.
    sudo cp hosts /etc/ansible

    This is the default dir, it can be any dir but then you
have to tell ansible where it is with the -i option (ansible -i <path>) 

# On OS X with homebrew installed Ansible, use this command:
    sudo cp hosts /usr/local/etc/ansible

    Ad hoc command line is just: 

    ansible <host_from_inventory_file> -u <user_if_different> -m <module_name>  -a "<args_if_any>"

    To run a play book, ours in particular: 

    ansible-playbook -e"vm=<vm-name> target=<target>  setup.yml  

    To get debug output: 

    ansible-playbook -vvv -e"vm=<vm-name> target=<target>  setup.yml

After the ansible setup, you need to add organism to the BLAST database, see the procedure under the manual setup documentation,
in the sphinx_doc/set_up_guide.rst



LOCAL SETUP 

Make sure /etc/ansible/hosts exist with an entry for the local machine.

From the install directory run:  

ansible-playbook -e "addr=<ipaddr> target=<system_name>" setup2.yml 

or

ansible-playbook -e "target=<system_name>" setup2.yml 

If you define addr, it will result in a new entry for this name and address in /etc/hosts, 
which would be unnecessary if an entry already exists.
