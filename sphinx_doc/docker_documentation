1. Download docker for windows: https://www.docker.com/docker-windows 
2. Download docker for mac :https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
3. After installing, go to settings to check feature of sharing drive is activated
4. Introduce some important and common commands to manipulate docker:
   check the current images:
       ```docker images```
   check all containers (include all of status):
       ```docker ps -a``` 
   remove docker image:
       ```docker rmi [imageID]```
   build and run docker container from image:
       ```docker run [option] imageID```
   remove docker container:
       ```docker rm [containerID]```
   execute container:
       ```docker exec -it [containerID] bash```
5. use Dockerfile to make customize image:
       some commands will be used in Dockerfile:
           1.FROM
           2.COPY
           3.ADD
           4.ENV
           5.CMD
           6.RUN
           7.WORKDIR 
    link to the websire to learn more detail for Dockerfile : https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
6. After completing Dockerfile use ```docker build . ``` to build the image
7. To run multiple-container docker application docker-compose is a good tool to acheive it 
   1. Make sure you have already installed both Docker Engine and Docker Compose. You donâ€™t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images.
   2. Create a Dockerfile
   3. Define services in a compose file (docker-compose.yml)
   4. run ```docker-compose up```
8. Example for Dockerfile:
     ```
     FROM python:3.4-alpine
     ADD . /code
     WORKDIR /code
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```
9. Example for docker-compose.yml
     ```
     version: '3'
     services:
      web:
       build: .
       ports:
        - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
        - .:/code
      redis:
       image: "redis:alpine"
       ```
